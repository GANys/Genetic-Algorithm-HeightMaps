# Genetic-Algorithm-HeightMaps

Genetic algorithm of points trying to reach a goal: trough successive generations, points are learning from the two "parents" to reach the goal. Parents are defined as the two most efficient points from the previous generation in regard of "moves to reach".

Several mutation parameters are available.
